Basic webbscraper school project. Enter an url of a webbpage to get the image url of the pictures on that page. The page we tested this program on was https://www.gp.se/.

Has the option to save images to your computer, either all of them or just some of them (by holding ctrl and selecting with the mouse). To clear the selected images, 
just press the clear button. When you have selected your images, press the "save images" button and choose a folder to save the images in. The program will also show you how 
many pictures you have saved on that separate occation. Unfortunately it overwrites every image that has the same name as the image saved.
